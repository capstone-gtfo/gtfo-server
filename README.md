### Introduction
Welcome to the server side of the stayOrGo capstone project. Our goal with project on our server was:
- To consume the National Weather Service api and return cleaned up data to our client side
- Accept user information including phone number and location data from our client side and store it in a database
- Return text messages to a user's phone based on whether or not a disaster is occuring in their geographic location

** Please note as this is a demo using a free Twilio account our website will only accept phone numbers that we have verified **

### API Endpoints
* POST https://stay-or-go-server.herokuapp.com/api/v1/users - *creates a user*

Must be in the following format:
```JSON
{
    "lat": "33.2896",
    "long": "-97.6982",
    "phone": "17204740636"
}
```

* GET /api/v1/disasters - *returns disasters for an area*

Must be in the following format:
* https://stay-or-go-server.herokuapp.com/api/v1/disasters?lat=33.2896&long=-97.6982

**Returns the following when disaster is occuring in the area**

### Set Up

This application runs on:
* Ruby 2.7.2
* Rails 5.2.8

#### Local Setup Instructions:
* Fork and Clone the repo
* Install gem packages: bundle install
* Setup the database: rake db:{drop,create,migrate,seed} (must have Postgres installed)
* Set up the schema and populate seed data: rails db:schema:dump

#### Test Suite

To run the test suit, simply run:
```Ruby
bundle exec rspec spec
```

Simplecov will display total test coverage when running the test suite. You can find a more detailed report by running:  open coverage/index.html

### CircleCi
We had some issues setting up continuous integration using the circleci service. We've narrowed the issue doen to either an issue with how our NWS_Service is interacting with circleci or an issue with our docker images how it interacts with our orb and dependencies.
